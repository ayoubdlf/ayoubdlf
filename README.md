# Hey, I'm Ayoub

I'm a full-stack developer focused on **TypeScript, modern web development, and cybersecurity**.  
I build web applications that are reliable, maintainable, and user-focused, and I actively hunt vulnerabilities on **HackerOne** to better understand systems from the inside out.

## About Me

- **TypeScript** is my favorite for keeping code structured, readable, and maintainable  
- Building web applications with **Next.js, Prisma, and TailwindCSS** allows fast iteration while maintaining clean, polished results  
- Exploring **Bun.js** for speed and simplicity, while still leveraging **Node.js** when needed  
- Working with **databases** like PostgreSQL and Supabase, usually via **Prisma** for clear and predictable data logic  
- **Docker** keeps project environments consistent across machines  
- Organizing work in **monorepos** helps manage growing and complex projects  
- Developed multiple projects in **Java**, from desktop applications to logic-heavy systems  
- Passionate about **cybersecurity and reverse engineering**, analyzing systems to understand their inner workings  
- Always experimenting, learning, and refining development practices

## Outside of Code

- I keep a structured routine outside of tech, regular gym training and calisthenics help me stay consistent and focused
- I run weekly with a club in Nancy, it's a good balance between discipline and community
- I value long-term habits and apply the same mindset to learning, building, and improving software
